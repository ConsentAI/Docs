# Contribution Guidelines for Consent Protocol

Welcome to the Consent Protocol contribution guidelines! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project and helping us build a decentralized, transparent, and secure ecosystem for human-AI collaboration. To ensure a smooth and effective contribution process, please follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Anonymity and Privacy

At Consent Protocol, we value the privacy and anonymity of our contributors. We encourage you to use pseudonyms or anonymous identities when contributing to the project. This helps protect your personal information and allows you to focus on the quality of your contributions rather than your identity.

Here are some tips for maintaining anonymity:

- Use a pseudonym or an anonymous username when creating accounts or profiles related to your contributions.
- Avoid sharing personal information, such as your real name, location, or contact details, in public forums or communication channels.
- Consider using a separate email address or communication channel specifically for your contributions to Consent Protocol.
- If you need to share sensitive information with the Repo Leads, use secure and encrypted communication methods.

## Contribution Types

Consent Protocol welcomes two types of contributions: single tasks and recurring tasks.

### Single Task Contributions

Single task contributions are one-time contributions that address a specific issue, feature, or improvement. These contributions can be made by anyone, regardless of their level of involvement with the project. To submit a single task contribution:

1. Identify an open issue, feature request, or improvement opportunity.
2. Fork the project's repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Develop, test, and document your changes.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of your changes and their impact.
5. Engage in the code review process and address any feedback or suggestions.

Submit your contribution on the the [Single task contributions table](link-to-single-task-contribution-table).

### Recurring Task Contributions

Recurring task contributions are ongoing contributions made by individuals who have been approved as recurring contributors. These contributors take on specific roles or responsibilities within the project and contribute on a regular basis. To become a recurring contributor:

1. Demonstrate your commitment and skills by successfully completing **at least three single task contributions**.
2. Express your interest in becoming a recurring contributor to the relevant Repo Lead.
3. Discuss the available roles, responsibilities, and expectations with the relevant Repo Lead.
4. Once approved, commit to contributing to the project on a recurring basis, as agreed upon with the relevant Repo Lead.

Already an approved recurring contributor? Submit your monthly contribution on the the [Monthly task contributions table](link-to-recurring-task-contribution-table).

## Contribution Workflow

Let's look at an example of how to contribute to Consent Protocol:

1. A contributor wants to translate the whitepaper from English to Spanish as they notice there is currently no Spanish translation available on the relevant Github repo.

2. They go on Discord to create a new thread in the "Contributions" channel to let community members know they intend to work on this. They may have additional questions related to the task, such as where to submit, who will be reviewing, or any other information they can't find. As a rule, it's good to do this first, but you can also just go ahead and do the work first, it's up to you.

3. They do the work and translate the whitepaper.

4. They submit the work on the relevant contributions table. In this case, the whitepaper falls within the "Community Sub-DAO". They can see this from the responsibilities examples of the Community Sub-DAO [here](https://github.com/Morlabs/DAO/blob/main/Governance%20structure.md).

5. It took the contributor 2 hours to complete this work, and they value their time at $30 per hour. So that would be $60. They enter their eth address, proof of work, description of work, $60, sub-dao = community, on the contributions table.

6. The Repo Lead of the Community Sub-DAO reviews the submission. They either approve it or amend it. They may or may not give feedback to the contributor - it's at their discretion.

7. At the end of the month, a snapshot is taken of the contributions that month. Let's say there are 10k USD worth of contributions that month in the Community Sub-DAO. And the Community Sub-DAO receives an emission of SEND from the Parent DAO of 100,000 SENT tokens in a given month. That means the contributor would earn (60/10,000)*100,000 = 600 SENT tokens for their contribution.

## Communication and Collaboration

Effective communication and collaboration are essential for the success of the Consent Protocol project. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- Be respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions with other contributors and community members.
- Use clear and concise language when communicating ideas, proposals, or feedback.
- Be open to constructive criticism and be willing to iterate on your contributions based on feedback.
- Collaborate with other contributors, share knowledge, and help each other grow and learn.
- Use the project's designated communication channels, such as chat platforms, forums, or mailing lists, to stay updated and engaged with the community.

## Recognition and Rewards

Consent Protocol values and recognizes the contributions of its community members. While the project operates on a voluntary basis, there may be opportunities for rewards, incentives, or recognition for significant contributions. The relevant Repo Lead will communicate any such opportunities as they arise.

Please note that Repo Leads will be elected by token holders after the initial term, ensuring a decentralized and community-driven governance structure.

We appreciate your dedication and efforts in contributing to Consent Protocol. Together, we can build a decentralized future where humans and AI collaborate harmoniously and transparently.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the relevant Repo Lead or the community. Happy contributing!
