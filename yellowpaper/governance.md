# Governance

The Consent ecosystem employs a decentralized governance structure, blending hierarchical and mesh organizational elements to ensure that the project remains adaptable, inclusive, and aligned with the community's interests.

## Hierarchical and Mesh Governance

At the core, governance within Consent combines both hierarchical and mesh organizational structures:

- **Parent or Global DAO**: Operated by individual humans who have verified their Ethereum addresses. This top-level DAO holds overarching authority over the entire ecosystem.
- **Sub-DAOs**: Focus on specific domains like cities, countries, regions, or industries, building and governing AI systems relevant to their focus areas within the overarching Consent framework.

## Optimistic Dual Governance Model

Consent introduces an "Optimistic Dual Governance" model, aiming to balance efficiency with inclusivity:

- **Active Group**: Consists of core teams, developers, and AI agents capable of proposing governance actions and protocol upgrades.
- **Passive Group**: Comprised of token holders and investors, holding veto power over proposals made by the Active Group.

Proposals from the Active Group proceed automatically after a timelock unless vetoed by the Passive Group, ensuring that operational teams can move quickly while maintaining accountability to the broader community.

## The Hats Protocol

The governance model utilizes the Hats Protocol to assign roles and responsibilities dynamically:

- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Hats, represented as ERC-1155 tokens, are used to grant permissions and responsibilities within the ecosystem. This flexible system allows for real-time adaptation to the ecosystem's needs.
- **Top Hat Token**: The core DAO, or a designated entity, holds the "Top Hat," allowing for the dynamic distribution of roles and permissions across the ecosystem.

## Multichain Governance

To accommodate its multi-chain nature, Consent leverages technologies like zkSync and LayerZero, enabling low-cost, scalable governance across different blockchain networks:

- **zkSync**: Utilized for scalable and cost-effective voting on the zkSync L2 rollup.
- **LayerZero**: Facilitates cross-chain messaging, ensuring governance actions are synchronized across supported networks.
