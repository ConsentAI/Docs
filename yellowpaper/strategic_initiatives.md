# Strategic Initiatives

The Consent Project is committed to pioneering strategic initiatives that bolster its ecosystem, enhancing interoperability, capital raising, and overall network sustainability. Below are key strategic initiatives currently underway.

## Multi-Chain Strategy

Consent aims to successfully realize its vision of a multi-chain ecosystem, strategically positioning the main SENT token on the Base network while maintaining a presence on Ethereum. This approach optimally leverages Ethereum's robust security and capital advantages, while Base serves as the foundation due to its low transaction costs and substantial pool of staked Ether (stETH), a critical resource for utilizing SENT in AI model inference.

SENT will operate seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, commencing with Base and Ethereum. This expansion was driven by the objective of enhancing SENT's accessibility and usability across various blockchain environments, thereby augmenting its utility and reach within the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape.

The implementation leverages LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) paradigm, enabling SENT to achieve instantaneous interoperability across different chains. This paradigm ensures the immutability and non-upgradability of contracts, offering a superior user experience through gas abstraction and an oracle function that standardizes yield contributions by denoting them in ETH price.

To facilitate cross-chain transactions, Consent has deployed the following key components:
- The OFT Adapter contract on Base, functioning as a secure gateway for token transfers between chains.
- Canonical OFT contracts on each new chain, where SENT tokens adapt to the native standards and functionalities of the respective network.

This framework not only simplifies the process of introducing SENT to new networks but also ensures that the token retains its core identity and utility across the blockchain spectrum. With the primary SENT token residing on Base and an additional layer on the same network, Consent achieves a delicate balance between leveraging Ethereum's security and tapping into Base's efficiency and stETH liquidity. This dual presence on Base enhances Consent's capabilities, allowing for innovative applications and broader participation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems.

Consent's multi-chain infrastructure signifies a significant stride towards a truly chain-agnostic ecosystem, where interoperability and seamless cross-chain functionality become the cornerstones of its expansion strategy.

## Capital Raising - XCombinator (XD)

Within the Consent network, every element, from AI Agents and front-end interfaces to code repositories, becomes a participatory force in the ecosystem when represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) with the capability to stake SENT. These components are seamlessly integrated into the Shared Yield Generator process, highlighting the network's innovative approach to capital contribution and project development.

### The XCombinator Framework: Advantages Over Traditional Models

The XCombinator framework offers several advantages over traditional capital raising models:
- **Indirect Capital Contribution**: Unlike conventional methods that require upfront capital investment, the focus here is on leveraging yield generation, minimizing direct financial barriers to participation.
- **Impermanent Loss Mitigation**: The framework sidesteps the common pitfalls of liquidity provision, including impermanent loss, fostering a more secure environment for contributors.
- **Sustained SENT Demand**: By basing rewards on yield generation, the Shared Yield Generator ensures ongoing demand for the SENT token, a vital factor for the ecosystem's longevity.
- **Growth in Protocol-Owned Liquidity**: The gradual increase in protocol-owned liquidity (POL) underpins the network's stability, creating a robust foundation for continuous growth.
- **Equity, Adaptability, and Scalability**: Designed with fairness in mind, the framework is versatile enough to be implemented across various blockchain networks, ensuring wide-reaching applicability.

### Capital Raising via YieldCombinator

At its core, the XCombinator facilitates the effortless launch and funding of open-source projects within the Consent network. Projects distribute native tokens through this framework, attracting staked Ether (stETH) contributions from users. In return, stakers receive project tokens proportionate to their contribution. This symbiotic relationship fortifies project support, with half of the generated yield reinvested in purchasing project tokens and the remainder enhancing automated market maker (AMM) liquidity.

### Implementation by Consent

Consent leads by example in adopting the YieldCombinator Smart Contracts, pioneering a method for open-source project launches. This model offers numerous benefits, including straightforward project initiation, permissionless integration, and the promotion of sustainable liquidity and demand for project tokens. It encapsulates Consent's ethos of leveraging collective resources to drive forward innovation and growth in the decentralized realm.

### Fee Generation and Ecosystem Support

Projects external to the Consent ecosystem can also utilize the Consent-developed Dashboard and associated smart contracts for capital raising. This inclusive strategy welcomes yield contributions, laying the groundwork for a sustainable financial ecosystem. Consent, in turn, applies a modest fee of 1% on the collected yield, whether in stETH or other supported yield bearing assets.
