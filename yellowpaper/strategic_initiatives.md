# Strategic Initiatives

The Consent Protocol is committed to pioneering strategic initiatives that bolster its ecosystem, enhancing interoperability, capital raising, and overall network sustainability. Below are key strategic initiatives currently underway.

## Multi-Chain Strategy

Consent aims to successfully realize its vision of a multi-chain ecosystem, strategically positioning the main SENT token on the Base network while maintaining a presence on Ethereum. This approach optimally leverages Ethereum's robust security and capital advantages, while Base serves as the foundation due to its low transaction costs and substantial pool of staked Ether (stETH), a critical resource for utilizing SENT in AI model inference.

SENT will operate seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, commencing with Base and Ethereum. This expansion was driven by the objective of enhancing SENT's accessibility and usability across various blockchain environments, thereby augmenting its utility and reach within the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape.

The implementation leverages LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) paradigm, enabling SENT to achieve instantaneous interoperability across different chains. This paradigm ensures the immutability and non-upgradability of contracts, offering a superior user experience through gas abstraction and an oracle function that standardizes yield contributions by denoting them in ETH price.

To facilitate cross-chain transactions, Consent has deployed the following key components:
- The OFT Adapter contract on Base, functioning as a secure gateway for token transfers between chains.
- Canonical OFT contracts on each new chain, where SENT tokens adapt to the native standards and functionalities of the respective network.

This framework not only simplifies the process of introducing SENT to new networks but also ensures that the token retains its core identity and utility across the blockchain spectrum. With the primary SENT token residing on Base and an additional layer on the same network, Consent achieves a delicate balance between leveraging Ethereum's security and tapping into Base's efficiency and stETH liquidity. This dual presence on Base enhances Consent's capabilities, allowing for innovative applications and broader participation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems.

Consent's multi-chain infrastructure signifies a significant stride towards a truly chain-agnostic ecosystem, where interoperability and seamless cross-chain functionality become the cornerstones of its expansion strategy.

## XCombinator: A Revolutionary Capital Raising Framework
XCombinator, inspired by the renowned YCombinator, is an innovative capital raising framework designed to support startups and organizations in their fundraising efforts. The key difference is that projects utilizing XCombinator do not need to be directly associated with the Consent Protocol, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of initiatives.

### How XCombinator Works
At the core of XCombinator is the concept of leveraging yield-bearing assets, such as staked Ether (stETH), to effectively donate a portion of their yield to support projects. In return, contributors can receive various incentives, depending on the project's structure:

- **Project's Native Token**: Many projects will choose to issue their own native tokens to contributors as a reward for their support.
- **SENT Tokens**: If the project is composed of NFTs with built-in SENT staking capabilities, contributors may receive SENT tokens as a reward for their participation.
- **Altruistic Contributions**: Some contributors may choose to pledge their support to projects without expecting any direct rewards, demonstrating a more altruistic approach to funding innovative ideas.

### The Role of Consent Protocol
While projects utilizing XCombinator do not need to be directly associated with Consent Protocol, the framework itself is built upon Consent's infrastructure. In return for providing this robust and secure fundraising platform, Consent Protocol earns a small fee, calculated as a percentage of the income generated through the XCombinator fundraising dashboard.

### Advantages of XCombinator
XCombinator offers several compelling advantages over traditional capital raising models:

- Indirect Capital Contribution: Unlike conventional methods that require upfront capital investment, XCombinator focuses on leveraging yield generation, minimizing direct financial barriers to participation.
- Impermanent Loss Mitigation: By design, XCombinator sidesteps the common pitfalls of liquidity provision, such as impermanent loss, fostering a more secure environment for contributors.
- Sustained SENT Demand: When projects are composed of NFTs with built-in SENT staking, the rewards based on yield generation ensure ongoing demand for the SENT token, contributing to the ecosystem's longevity.
- Equity, Adaptability, and Scalability: Designed with fairness in mind, XCombinator is versatile enough to be implemented across various blockchain networks, ensuring wide-reaching applicability and scalability.

### The XCombinator Workflow
The XCombinator framework facilitates the seamless launch and funding of open-source projects within the Consent network. Projects can distribute their native tokens through this framework, attracting staked Ether (stETH) contributions from users. In return, stakers receive project tokens proportionate to their contribution.

This symbiotic relationship fortifies project support, with a portion of the generated yield reinvested in purchasing project tokens and the remainder enhancing automated market maker (AMM) liquidity. Consent leads by example, adopting the XCombinator Smart Contracts and pioneering a method for open-source project launches.

### Ecosystem Support and Fee Generation
Projects external to the Consent ecosystem can also utilize the Consent-developed Dashboard and associated smart contracts for capital raising. This inclusive strategy welcomes yield contributions, laying the groundwork for a sustainable financial ecosystem.

### In exchange for providing the infrastructure and tools, Consent applies a modest fee of 1% on the collected yield, whether in stETH or other supported yield-bearing assets. This fee directly contributes to the relevant SENT trading pair. For instance, fees generated in stETH would be allocated to the SENT/stETH liquidity pool on Uniswap, effectively increasing SENT liquidity.

### Growth in Protocol-Owned Liquidity
As projects utilizing XCombinator flourish, the gradual increase in protocol-owned liquidity (POL) underpins the stability of the Consent network, creating a robust foundation for continuous growth. The 1% fee generated from XCombinator projects is strategically allocated to SENT liquidity pools across various yield-bearing assets and major blockchain networks.

This approach enables SENT to maintain deep liquidity across all major chains and yield-bearing assets, enhancing its accessibility and usability within the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. By fostering a strong and diverse liquidity base, Consent Protocol ensures the long-term stability and success of the SENT token and the XCombinator framework.
