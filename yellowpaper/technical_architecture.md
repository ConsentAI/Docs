# Technical Architecture

The Consent Project's technical framework synergizes blockchain's decentralized, immutable nature with the transformative power of artificial intelligence. The architecture supports diverse components including AI Agents (and their NFT representations), decentralized nodes, and AI inference mechanisms, underpinned by a robust tech stack facilitating functionality and interoperability.

## Tech Stack

The system's architecture is built on a curated tech stack designed for robustness, scalability, and user-friendliness:

- **Llama2**: Open-source Large Language Model (LLM) providing core AI capabilities. [Learn More](https://github.com/OpenAI/llama)
- **Ollama**: Tool simplifying Llama2 installation and deployment. [Placeholder for actual link]
- **LangChain**: Bridges LLMs with vector stores/APIs for complex AI functionalities. [Placeholder for actual link]
- **LangSmith Editor**: Low-code platform for building AI Agents on LangChain. [Placeholder for actual link]
- Additional components include SmartContractRank Algorithm, AgentRank Algorithm, PromptRank Algorithm, Filecoin, Akash Network, and Wallet Connect, each integral to the functioning and scalability of the Consent ecosystem.

## AI Agents

AI Agents interpret human language and translate it into actionable commands for Web3 interactions, using LLM Transformer models. They act as intermediaries between humans and blockchain, facilitating smart contract execution based on user or group intent.

## Nodes & Decentralised AI Inference

The ecosystem leverages decentralized nodes for AI inference, providing computational resources critical for AI operations. This setup ensures the smooth functioning of AI Agents and supports decentralized model registries.

## Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems allow AI Agents to collaborate, share resources, and delegate tasks, enhancing the ecosystem's capabilities. This framework supports dynamic human-AI federations, promoting cooperative problem-solving and innovation.

## Consent Local

Consent Local is a desktop application that integrates AI capabilities with blockchain technology, offering services like secure communication, intelligent language processing, and blockchain transactions within a user-friendly interface.

## Identity & Attestations

Utilizing attestations, Consent verifies user identities and enables participation in decentralized governance. This system links attestations to Ethereum wallets, confirming user eligibility for governance activities.

## Data Commons

Data Commons is an initiative to create an open, accessible dataset repository. It supports AI development with high-quality, diverse datasets, reflecting the intricate details of different cultures and communities.

This summary of the "Technical Architecture" section of the yellow paper highlights the Consent Project's innovative integration of blockchain and AI technologies. Detailed information about each component can be found in their respective subsections within the full documentation.
