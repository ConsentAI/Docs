# Tokenomics

## SENT: The Principal Currency

SENT is the native token of the Consent ecosystem, serving as the foundation for transactions and various network activities. It plays a crucial role in rewarding users for their engagement with the software and allocating access to computational resources, directly correlating to the quantity of SENT a user holds.

## Dynamic Distribution

The distribution of SENT tokens is not fixed but determined by two key mechanisms:

1. **Protocol NFT Staking (50% Allocation):** The NFT that has received the highest relative stake from the community receives the highest proportion of token emissions. 50% of the total SENT distribution is allocated in this manner, incentivizing community support for promising protocol NFTs.

2. **DAO-Controlled Pools (50% Allocation):** The remaining 50% of the SENT distribution is controlled by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where token holders can vote on the creation and cancellation of specific distribution pools.

## Protocl NFT Staking

Within the Consent ecosystem, every network component is represented as an NFT, such as authorized AI Agents, AI Agent User Interfaces (UIs), AI Agent Tools, and Core Infrastructure Components. SENT token holders can stake their tokens in compatible protocol NFT they wish to support or believe in, enabling a broad spectrum of project support.

Token emissions directed to each AI Agent are proportional to the total amount of SENT staked to that AI Agent, subsequently distributed to individual stakers. This creates a sophisticated Agent investment marketplace where competition and market dynamics incentivize AI Agents to self-improve over time.

## DAO-Controlled Pools

Initially, the DAO-controlled pools include:

- **Capital Contributors Pool:** Rewards contributors who provide capital to the ecosystem.
- **Ecosystem Contributors Pool:** Incentivizes community members who actively contribute to the growth and development of the ecosystem.
- **Compute Providers Pool:** Compensates entities that provide computational resources to the network.
- **Protection Pool:** A smaller allocation dedicated to safeguarding the ecosystem's security and integrity.

The DAO can vote to adjust the emissions allocated to each pool, collapse them or create new ones, ensuring flexibility and community governance over the token distribution.
